# CEBRA-Demo
This repository contains a concise demo and example on how to use CEBRA with your datasets.
It will regularly be updated with more examples.

For first-time users, the Basics notebook is a good place to start. It contains snippets and examples from the original CEBRA demos on their website: https://cebra.ai/docs/demos.html (refer to these for more details).

Once you have a basic idea of how CEBRA works and you want to use it on your data, take a look at the examples starting with the AIND-Data notebook.
