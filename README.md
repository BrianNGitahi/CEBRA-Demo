# CEBRA-Demo
This is a repository documenting some of the analyses performed with CEBRA on neuromodulator data acquired using fiber-photometry. 
Specifically, the data is 4 neuromodulator's recorded simultaneously from the Nuclues Acumbens (there exists data from other regions..but these notebooks are using data from there).

For a quick primer on CEBRA see the notebooks in the CEBRA_Pack repository, also linked on this webpage:https://brianngitahi.github.io/. 

NB: 
- If you'd like to understand how the input data has been formatted, see the notebook: Signal_rewarded_unrewarded.ipynb
